robot ecosystem operation code

This module creates a test ecosystem and runs it for a specified duration, 
demonstrating the use of the ecosystem factory and deliverable creation functions
It simulates the operation of delivery bots, including charging and delivering pizzas, while providing options for debugging and message display.
